<h1 align="center">RecipeLib Web App</h1>

This is my final project for [Harvard University - CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/) course. It is an open library of food recipes for all tastes! Everyone can create an account and post their favorite recipes.

## Why this project? <a name="-why-this-project" style="text-decoration:none"></a>

This application uses the concepts of back-end with Django and front-end with HTML, CSS and JavaScript learned in the course and goes further. It explores image upload and storage, interactive visual effects when uploading and displaying images and texts, pagination and search filter in the recipe library.

## What's in the files? <a name="-whats-in-files" style="text-decoration:none"></a>
- **views.py**: all the back-end logic to query database and display the recipes accordingly to user's search and functions to manage user's own recipes, creating, editing and deleting contents;
- **models.py**: my 3 models of User, Recipe and File and their relationship, including logic to save the uploaded files to local storage;
- **static/styles**: more than 1,000 lines of CSS code for standard and mobile-responsive design;
- **static/site & admin**: all the front-end logic to dynamic change the page, including visual display of files during the upload;
- **static/assets/**: the immutable images;
- **static/images/**: the recipes mutable images;
- **templates**: all the pages accessed by all users;
- **templates/admin**: all the pages accessed only by logged in users to manage their recipes.
